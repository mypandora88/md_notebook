## A brief introduce of myself
Hello, everyone, thank you for your interview.  

My name is JiangQingshan. I’ve graduated from Sichuan University in 2010 and my major is Water Resource and Hydropower Engineering. I have over 7 years of experience in electric. I think I am quite fit for this job.  

First, I have electrical design experience, I have designed both 380V and 10kV panel. Electrical primary and electrical secondary design.  

Second, I have electrical commissioning experience, at power plant, I have many opportunities to research those equipment, including Schneider breaker and 10kV panel.  

Third, my English is well, I have worked in Mongolia for one year, there we need to use English to communicate with each other, although I haven’t use English for almost 2 years, but I am sure I can catch up in 2 months surrounded in English atmosphere.  

I have always dreamed of working for a large company like schneider. because I believe I can learn more.  

Thank you for giving me this chance.
